# ShapesHalogenHooks

Demonstrates rendering of SVG shapes.

A Halogen port of the ["Shapes" Elm Example](https://elm-lang.org/examples/shapes).

This recipe uses the library [purescript-halogen-svg-elems](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-halogen-svg-elems) which, at time of development, is better maintained than [purescript-halogen-svg](https://github.com/kwohlfahrt/purescript-halogen-svg).

Good advice copied from the Elm example:
There are a lot of odd things about SVG, so always try to find examples to help you understand the weird stuff. Like these:
* https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_examples.asp
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d

If you cannot find relevant examples, make an experiment. If you push through the weirdness, you can do a lot with SVG.
